I have always dreamt of building a gaming pc. I have decided to finally build my first gaming pc!

### Criteria 
1. Budget
  - The budget i have set is no more than 1.3k
1. Specifications 
  - I want the pc to be on the smaller side
  - It must be able to be compatible with Metal Gear Solid, Street Fighter, Call of Duty.
1. Lastly I want to build a pc that is more on the smaller side. I'm not a big fan of big pc's. I like clean and functional; it needs to fit in my room lol.
